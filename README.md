# Simple-Play-Station-GPU
This a project based on the working of Play Station GPU 
This project simulates a simplified version of the PlayStation Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) using Python. The aim is to provide a hands-on understanding of the fundamental GPU operations such as rendering, rasterization, and shading. It helps in visualizing how 3D scenes are processed and displayed on the screen.

Installation
To run this project, you’ll need Python and a few libraries. You can install the required dependencies by using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python
Alternatively, if you're using Google Colab, the dependencies are pre-installed.

Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can use the following commands to run the simulation:

Download or Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code

cd PlayStation-GPU-Simulation
Run the simulation:

bash
Copy code
python gpu_simulation.py
Sample Output
This simulation renders a simple triangle in a 2D space with basic shading. The output will be a static image showing the rendered triangle.

Working Principles
The Simple PlayStation GPU Simulator mimics key GPU operations:

Frame Buffer Creation: A 2D array is created to represent the pixel data of the rendered scene.

Vertex Processing: The positions of vertices are transformed (translated, scaled, rotated) in 2D space.

Rasterization: Geometric shapes such as triangles are broken down into individual pixels.

Fragment Processing: Each pixel (fragment) is colored based on its position and texture.

Double Buffering: A back buffer and a front buffer are used for smooth transitions.

Memory Simulation: The simulator uses a small VRAM model to store textures and frame buffer data.

Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for the simulation.
NumPy: Efficient numerical operations for matrix manipulations and transformations.
Matplotlib: Visualization library for rendering images of the frame buffer.
OpenCV: Optional, used for more advanced image processing if needed.
Google Colab: Cloud-based environment for running the simulation without any local setup.
